I don't think 'Did you just assume?' has to demean anyone.  It's a meme.  That is my only point and if you don't like it then don't.

Took the words right out of my mouth, minus the EU stuff as I haven't read those. I still don't understand people who say that they're glad Rey and stable kids are no one's.

The ending is a beginning. Again. And so on.
Maybe most women have orgasms that are clitoral, but I think most women like the feeling of being penetrated because it's a turn-on to feel 'full'. I can't imagine being penetrated by a short-pencil dick could be a turn-on to most women. Not saying that there aren't other things that the man could do to compensate, but objectively, they are worse off than a man who has a bigger/average penis.

Hi, I'm from the future. Oh what a wonderful debut goal it was. 
Please save me the $10 and just explain how I misremembered. I just remembered Kylo 'killing' Luke through his projection.
Yeah, I totally get that.  It was a last minute addition, otherwise would have price shopped.  I figured $30 for 32' of LEDs, color changing, plus a remote to operate the light...wasn't that bad.

I remember seeing this earlier in the year. If I remember correctly the guy was high on some drug, kicked in the door, and threw the grandmother into the tv. Others tried to stop him but couldn‚Äôt.

Yep, I completely responded to the wrong comment.  newlinechar Oh well, at least I know what my most downvoted comment of all time is now. 
This. I've always felt that non-answers like 'I'm a perfectionist' or 'I get too devoted to a project' are really an indicator of 'I can't recognize when I'm not good at something.' Much better to actually prove you can evaluate yourself.

Where do you find buyers for used dead tree fiction? Pretty hard to imagine to me. I used to have a pretty large collection 10 years ago before ebooks were really a thing, but when moving I ended up donating it to a library - who wants to buy a used book years after its release?

Also betting lines aren't always accurate. They are fairly decent most of the time but you get odds that don't reflect styles. Holly Holm shouldn't have been +2000 against Ronda Rousey.
