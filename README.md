# TFChatbot


I don't know yet

Maybe it'll work at some point... maybe not...

It's supposed to be better than the chatbot I tried making last year, but I don't know if this will actually work


It's supposed to be decent after it learns from Reddit comments, but knowing Redditors, it'll probably be pretty bad.
