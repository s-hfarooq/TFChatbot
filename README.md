# TFChatbot
[Bot Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAnAtoN/), and [Bot Account](https://www.reddit.com/u/IAnAtoN/)

It does currently work, but it's not always online, and it's responses still aren't very good.

The current bot is based on comments from 2018, with approximately 200k training samples.

Quite a few of the files are too large to upload to GitHub (.db files, .train files, model files), so you'll have to create these yourself. Only the model files along with this repo in order to run it yourself. Place these into the ``model`` directory.

If you want to download the (7.7gb download, 60gb uncompressed) text file where I got the Reddit comments (2018 data), click [here](http://files.pushshift.io/reddit/comments/RC_2018-01.xz "Reddit Comments 2018-01").
