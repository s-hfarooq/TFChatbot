# TFChatbot
[Bot Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAnAtoN/), and [Bot Account](https://www.reddit.com/u/IAnAtoN/)

It does currently work, but it's not always online, and it's responses still aren't very good.

The current bot is based on comments from 2015, but I'm currently working on using the 2018 data.

Quite a few of the files are too large to upload to GitHub (.db files, .train files, model files), so you'll have to create these yourself.

If you want to download the (7.7gb download, 60gb uncompressed) text file where I got the Reddit comments (2018 data), click [here](http://files.pushshift.io/reddit/comments/RC_2018-01.xz "Reddit Comments 2018-01").
