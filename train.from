It’s one of the year end specials broadcasted to usher in the new year as is now their custom, this one belongs to Himuro’s OVA which also has a Fuyuki grail war that’s ridiculously well animated. They also state that they hope to top what they did for 2017’s year end in this year too, it’s really insane.
That can happen if you’re defensive player intercepts a pass at the 1, runs it into the end zone, and then gets tackled. Definitely unfortunate

If by '*very* powerful' you mean an entry level i3 and a cheap GTX 1050, then I agree.  You'll have trouble on the VR gaming side of things, but even such a low-end system will laugh at 5K H.265 content (in fact on the Windows MR side of things you probably don't even need the 1050 as even modern low-end i3 chips are capable of handling 5K thanks to Intel's Quick Sync Video architecture). newlinechar    newlinechar And to bring even more perspective to this, a 2016 smartphone with an Exynos 8890 SOC, which is at least an order of magnitude (maybe 2) less powerful than a typical desktop PC, can chew through 5K HEVC content as well.  This is because it's not really about how _powerful_ your device is in any traditional sense, it's about whether it has the right dedicated video processing architecture (as you do in fact seem to understand).

I would just say that the only reason anyone (alt-right or otherwise) continues to do the sign is because of people freaking out.  If we don’t just ignore them we are providing them with power.

Although I believe she very well did self harm before due to the subtle hints throughout the game. If you follow Yuri like I did you encounter multiple scenes where there are pieces of text that indicate her cutting and when she runs off out the room to cut and also when she goes to your house to help out with the festival she mentions her knife 'collection' while carrying a sharp knife which you then cut your finger on.

I'm a Deist, like many of our founding fathers. I do not believe God send hurricanes because of 'the gays' nor do I believe sweaters bought second hand can be possessed by the devil. (My family is very Holy Roller Christians, you know taking in tongues etc.) I believe God/universe whatever you want to call it created everything and science let's us see a bit into the inner workings. I believe math is the music of God, and if we listen we can hear the magic of life. Granted I suck at math but still I can look at a fibonacci sequence in nature and get shivers. My mom thinks I'm going to hell.

I feel like DF is an absolute masterpiece in terms of concept and simulation, but it utterly fails as a game. I don't think it needs fantastic art. The UI is just far too problematic. You have to click like 5 times? to check what your dwarfs are thinking. And without dwarf therapist, good luck assigning jobs to your dwarfs. It doesn't need amazing graphics. it just needs to not read like a NASA control station.

Also, America is the only country _in the world_ not to have ratified the U.N.

Prior to in-home dialysis she could have arranged a visit to any dialysis clinic in the area she was traveling to. Now, she has a machine that she can pack up and take with her as luggage. She was psyched to get the in-home setup because she said it would be easier to travel. But I’m not sure how that works because her insurance had to pay for an electrician and plumber to come to her house to get it ready for the machine. So I don’t see how she could just plug her machine in anywhere she went. Either way, there are dialysis clinics everywhere, so that’s always an option if she needs it.

It's not so weak anymore since last year (and the early heat-celtics matchups but celtics were just getting really old those last 1 or 2 matchups), although you are correct overall, and you could also argue it's weak because of lebron.

The government has promised things to the populace (via socialism) that they cannot pay for. newlinechar  newlinechar They're going to have to renegotiate their social contract and they can't realistically do that and stay in power. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm not all against socialism, but this is a coffin corner that socialistic governments can get into (especially in South America) and it's bad for the country and the people.

90% of weight loss for you right now will be in diet, not in exercise. You also don't really need to hate what you eat, just cut back on portions. Calories in, calories out. If you're at 450ish pounds you legit just need under 3000 calories to lose weight. Of course the lowest you can go is the best you can do. Probably just shy of 2000 would be ideal for you until you're at like 300 pounds, at which point transitioning to a more normal low calorie diet of like 1600-1800 would be appropriate.  newlinechar  newlinechar This video contains the only pieces of advice that ever resonated with me, so I feel obligated to pass it on: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SSKjQoutT4 newlinechar  newlinechar That video also stresses the same point that you can cut easily with just portion sizes (and in following the general advice contained within I myself have lost a fair bit of weight). newlinechar  newlinechar If you'd rather a system over just guidelines, I would imagine Keto would be disproportionately effective for your circumstance. That said, the first 5 days of Keto are super AIDS and Keto almost intrinsically bottlenecks the idea of cheat days (which the majority of literature on the subject seems to suggest is a borderline necessary fail-safe for dieting). I've tried Keto and personally tapped out, but maybe you can make it through to ketosis easier than I. The r/keto subreddit is pretty active from what I recall as well. newlinechar  newlinechar As for depression... It sorta depends on circumstance but I'm certainly not convinced distraction is the best way to go. Try organizing smaller things in your life, focus on that. You have a good option to work with right now - a practical one. Get your diet in order, figure out what you're doing for whatever meals you're having for a day. Maybe after you've done that to such a degree you don't need to think (or worry) about food, you could try and bring to order some other small aspect of your life. Clean the immediate area you tend to hang around in. Clean it - really clean it, get it in good shape, make it somewhere you'd like to be. If your mobility permits, use that as a foundation and work your way through the entire room. Those few 'small' things may seem small, but they're not, they're important. It's also not easy to sort out your food in such a way that you don't need to put much effort into it - or clean your room to such a degree that you know when something is wrong with it. It takes time. Focus on a single 'small' thing, sort it out thoroughly. Locate another small thing you'd like to improve, focus on just that one thing and continue.  newlinechar  newlinechar If you don't like the picture of your life, the reason is likely due to a multiplicity of small imperfections you see. Pick one - the smallest one you can - and correct it. Each imperfection remedied is a victory, no matter how small or benign the problem is.

&gt;I think 'go to the store' includes the action of returning.

Some people consider a steakhouse a nice dinner. You're looking at $100 for a steak for 2 with no sides, $15 per drink and $10-30 per side. That being said, a month's worth of groceries is typically $30-70 for me, so I tend not to go to those types of places. My dad's retirement income is about 3-4x my full-time job income, so he'll occasionally take me out to a nice place for my birthday.

Thing is, if there genuinely was an investigation on betting syndicates and they really did prove that Mike Dean was in on it, nobody would be surprised. If you had a weekend where the two main Premier League news items were that Mike Dean had been caught accepting bribes and that one of the week's games had ended in a goalless draw, the draw would be more surprising than the bribe.
'I have eaten' makes a statement about the present context, and 'I had eaten' makes a statement about a past context, so I would say that the difference between 'I have eaten' and 'I had eaten' is the same as the difference between 'I will have eaten' and 'I have eaten'.  Or are you proposing that English has a remote future tense and that 'I will have eaten' is making a statement about a remote future context?

What about a family history of CJD?  If you can’t donate blood, it seems like organs would be out too?  In our case, the family member had symptoms of CJD, but there was no autopsy, so no definite diagnosis.

The surge prices really aren't that bad, considering.   newlinechar  newlinechar I paid a 6.6 multiplier surge last NYE, but getting a 7 passenger vehicle in 2 minutes at 2:30 AM on NYE is well worth the 6.6 surge pricing. newlinechar  newlinechar I strongly suspect that a lot of people are going to ditch NYE or simply go to someone's home for NYE, meaning that demand will be down.  Meanwhile, drivers know that surge prices are the best times to drive.  Bottom line:  I doubt the surges are more than a 3 multiplier.

Organ is usually less strict compared to tissue (bone and skin). Organ donation has increased due to the opioids crisis. Some people are concerned because they're getting an organ from someone who has OD, but organs are perfused and flushed thoroughly before transplant. Tissue has more rule outs for donation.  newlinechar  newlinechar I wouldn't know about OJD, someone on the clinical side would know more than me. However, there is plenty of blood work and exams done, along with family history if available, before the donor actually donates their organ.

Yup, and just to add, in the US the zip codes cover much larger areas and number of properties.  In the UK I believe a postcode narrows it down to say under 30 properties, whilst in the US a single zip covers thousands of properties.

Completely agree with all of this. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, OP, you mention that your university has a study abroad opportunity in Japan. Great! Do that. It's a low-risk way to experience some aspects of life in Japan and see what it's about. I'd recommend going to a Tokyo university if you can, for the simple reason that if you do eventually move here, you'll probably have to live in Tokyo - that's where almost all the non-English teaching jobs for foreigners are. You sound like someone who idealises the kind of small-city, small-community sort of life, and you need to be 100% stone cold aware of the fact that with a very few exceptions, that kind of place in Japan has *no decent employment for foreigners* and will not be accessible to you - you'll have to live in a large city and I suspect that you'll find that a bit disappointing given your (frankly slightly naïve and outdated) ideas about Japan being so community- and family-centric.  newlinechar  newlinechar One other thing I'd add. You can broadly speaking categorise foreigners in Japan into two groups - those who are happy, content and well-settled here, and those who are bitter, angry and constantly complaining. There are a lot of things that divide those two groups (the former tends to have put in the time and effort to learn the language properly, for instance), but one of the really big indicators of how someone is going to get along in Japan is how they got along with their home country. The people who enjoy their lives in Japan tend to also speak very fondly of their home country; those who dislike their home country also tend to be angry and disappointed at Japan *constantly*, because they came here to 'escape' from what they see as their home country's flaws, and feel constantly upset that Japan, like any nation, is *just as flawed*. I'd strongly recommend taking the time to chill out and make your peace with your home country before making any big decisions about getting out of there.
That would require the astronauts to be prepared for every single thing that could go wrong.

I agree 100% with your first tow paragraphs. Didn't read of other women having this exact opinion much before. newlinechar  newlinechar I can see where you're coming from with the third part, but I probably wouldn't abstain of stereotypically feminine behavior if it was appealing to me even with the awareness that it might be partially a product of patriarchy. There are women/men who happily engage in makeup, sexualizing themselves etc (for some reason). I think ideally we'd live in a society where you could choose this kind of behavior regardless of sex. Then it wouldn't be a sign of opression either. And both genders would be more happy and free I guess.

Oh, they were absolutely better.  The new songs employ awkward melodies and rhythms.  The old ones, outside of a few notable exceptions, were just better. newlinechar  newlinechar If you ask even a witness to sing 'Happy Birthday' or 'Jingle Bells' they can do it.  Why?

The Mormons (imo) can't support trans people, because of their strict views on marriage, and the fact that their priesthood can only be held by a male.  newlinechar The only marriage that is acceptable is an eternal one, between a man and a woman. Leaving the issues they have with Gay people for another conversation, what happens in a couple when a spouse comes out as being  trans? newlinechar They can't encourage divorce, because that marriage was witnessed before God in a sacred building and meant to be eternal. They loathe to break those marriages. But they can't stay together, as that would be gay, one of the few 'sins' that they will label you as an apostate for. newlinechar The easiest answer for them is to pretend trans people don't exist. newlinechar Again with the priesthood. Being amab, I was given that holy authority and power. If they admitted to me being a woman, then was my power fake during those years? If so, why did people feel it when I have blessings? If not, then apparently a woman was able to have the priesthood. (That warrants another discussion, but the operative answer they have, which they consider God's law, is that women cannot have it.) newlinechar So again, they're in a catch 22 that's only solved by pretending trans people don't exist.

Let me explain why fees are important newlinechar  newlinechar The network involves an intrinsically scarce resource which is block space. This resource is intrinsically scarce in the same way that a boat has a load capacity. Go beyond that load capacity and the boat sinks. Likewise, go beyond a certain amount of data in the blockchain and the network sinks by losing its decentralization which is what gives it its security. Consequently, the amount of data that can be processed must remain limited and therefore users must compete over who gets to actually input data into the blockchain. newlinechar  newlinechar Users compete by essentially paying the miners a bribe, which we call a 'fee.' It is worth noting that in the very early days when bitcoin was unpopular, transactions were free. And transactions would still be free if there weren't so many people trying to get through the door at once. Miners are like bouncers who have to decide who to let in first. Naturally, the best way to get the bouncer to let you in first is to pay him, and that's what we are doing when we pay transaction fees. If fees were based on a fixed percentage, low value transactions with correspondingly low fees would never get confirmed because miners would always favor the higher value transactions with their juicier fees. newlinechar  newlinechar The blockchain is not designed for cheap low value transactions, it intrinsically favors high value transactions. This is because for high value transactions, the percentage the fee represents is small, whereas for low value transactions the fee quickly becomes a large percentage of the value of the transaction. That is, for high value transactions, fees are cheap, percentage wise. For low value transactions, on the other hand, they are expensive. newlinechar  newlinechar So it is important to understand that the blockchain is a value transfer layer, and as a value transfer layer it is by its nature designed to favor high value transfers over low value transfers. newlinechar  newlinechar The more payment networks come to be relied upon for small value transactions -- and the more people use them as opposed to trying to get every transaction into the blockchain directly -- the less people are fighting over the scarce resource known as block space, consequently the cheaper block space becomes. That is, payment networks not only offer a cheap way to transact for low value payments, but they also reduce the costs of high value transactions on the blockchain itself. newlinechar  newlinechar Roger Ver's confusion -- along with many who agree with him -- is that he thinks of the blockchain as an efficient payment network. It's not. Just look at the electricity expenses that are going into making transactions on the blockchain possible. Right now the network is consuming as much energy as the country Ireland? All that energy is not being spent on making transactions cheap or fast -- additional mining power has a negligible affect on the speed of bitcoin as the protocol always seeks to maintain 10 minute confirmation times, and additional mining power has a negligible affect on the price of fees as that is determined most principally by the fact that there is a limited supply of block space. newlinechar  newlinechar No. That energy is being spent entirely on securing the network. The blockchain is about security first, not cheap payments. Cheap payments will come with Lightning and other such payment networks, but the purpose of the blockchain is first and foremost about securing a global public ledger. newlinechar  newlinechar What you want is the security layer to be secure, and the payment layer to be fast and cheap. The two combined (along with so much more) is what will eventually be considered Bitcoin (much like people ceased to differentiate the internet from the web). What you don't want is to try to use the security layer as the payment network so that it isn't secure. And since the blockchain, the security layer as it were, isn't particularly fast or cheap, any network that attempts to use the blockchain as a payment network to compete with networks specifically designed to be payment networks, like Lightning, will in the long run fail.

You can find them pretty easy. Sur la Table is probably the most common store that carries aged stuff, but you can find some online and at local cooking stores. I've even found decent Private Select (kroger brand) but those don't tend to stay on the shelf long. Balsamic de Modena with an IGP label ensures some level of authenticity / quality regulation, so ignore anything without it in most cases. newlinechar  newlinechar Aged balsamic is thicker and more rich. The flavor goes from tangy to sweet over time and gets a more recognizable complexity to the flavor profile. To appreciate that you make it the forefront of simpler dishes. Cheap stuff is for salad where it's a back flavor, I like 5-15 year for simple savory like caprese, and bruschetta, and the real expensive stuff is great for anything similar but also works better than mid-range stuff for sweet dishes and fruit. The cheapest is like tangy water and the best is like syrup. In the store you can get a good read on quality by making sure ingredients don't have sweeteners or thickeners and seeing how it sticks to the bottle when you swish it around. Anything over 10 years should give an obvious film coating that takes a couple minutes to settle back off the bottle.

I get that the OP of this thread did say 'or die' as if people dying wouldn't be accepted, and there's a separate discussion going about how the cost of not dying may end up actually causing you to die itself(or wish you did). newlinechar  newlinechar That aside, can we agree that it is bad that we have a healthcare system where for example I may have Strep, but it costs money(copay) to go find out if it's actually strep or just a really sore throat. Money I may not have. newlinechar  newlinechar Maybe I broke a bone and it's really bad and while the ER stabalized me and made it so it's not at risk of infection or life threatening, they suggest a follow up visit to discuss surgical options so that fracture doesn't impact my life. Oops can't afford that my deductible is 4 grand and specialist visits to an ortho are a 40% coinsurance so they don't even go towards it if something happens later in the year. newlinechar  newlinechar That's our system. It actively discourages people on the lower end of the spectrum to use the insurance they pay for, and to avoid any visit that isn't 'preventative care' or in the dental version 'cleaning.' This is why when the mandate drops insurance premiums will skyrocket, because people in this situation are facing the exact same outcomes whether they are insured or not.
Roman Catholics have painted themselves into a similar corner with the *in persona Christi* thing: basically women cannot represent Christ in sacraments except when we can (*anyone* can administer baptism.

I work IT in a hospital. I encounter patients in the ER, Pre-Op, PACU, sometimes even the OR.

He's still just a kid. newlinechar  newlinechar He only had that much tech at his disposal because Iron Man's kind of a shit mentor. He should've gone with Cap. Tony just made him the suit and expected him to not tamper with it. That being said, if Peter hadn't gone and messed with it, he would've been standard Spider-Man the whole time. newlinechar  newlinechar I'd bet that he'll end up ditching all the bells and whistles by the end of Spider-Man 2. Hell, maybe even Infinity War or Avengers 4. He's still learning his abilities. He's only had them for like, a year by the time Infinity War comes around. It's only natural that he'd find something to lean on while he's learning his limitations. It's not like Iron Man or any of the other Avengers are really taking an interest in his development. newlinechar  newlinechar Even still, most of the tech he had in the movie is stuff he's had in some form or another in different stages of his career in the comics. newlinechar  newlinechar The spider-tracer (the drone in his chest) is something he's had since before the Clone Saga (I can't find a specific time frame) newlinechar  newlinechar The spider-signal as well, although he hasn't used like, at all. newlinechar  newlinechar The eyes are just a way to use the expressive features he's had since the 60s. newlinechar  newlinechar The only two things in the movie that he hasn't had in the comics, as far as I know, are the instant kill mode and the web combinations.

Trick was 3 years older, so one can assume he is 18 when all this occured. What threw me off in this episode however was how old Sara looked - she didn't look close to 15. This may have lessened the impact on viewers in certain scenes.

Her little girl, who once was so innocent, now hanging out with drug dealers, snorting cocaine and having unprotected sex. (even though Trick was a good guy in a way, but the mother didn't know that)

I used to have really long, straight hair.

She made sort of a pleased sound and said “damn, I bet your girlfriend is jealous!” then proceeded to chuckle at her own joke. I basically stood there dumbfounded cause I was a 20 year old skinny white boy and I simply didn’t know how to respond. I think I said thank you and blushed, but that was 13 years ago.

I'd say don't bother until you can champ one.

It can differ with each person but I think the rebelling part has more to do with being raised in an extreme lifestyle one way or the other.

&gt; Marx wanted a classless society, where everyone has the same resources.  newlinechar  newlinechar That would be absurd.  Why would I, as a non-diabetic need insulin? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Money is a representation of resources. newlinechar  newlinechar Money, according to Marx, since that's who you seem to be critiquing (or at least attempting to) believe money to be a representation of abstract value.  Abstract value was, quite contrary to 'resources,' not concrete (as the name 'abstract' implies). newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; More money = more resources. newlinechar  newlinechar In capitalism, yes. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Therefore I equate wages with the amount of resources a person has access to. newlinechar  newlinechar That's still, the richest people in the world who have access to all sorts of resources are not wage workers. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; So if a store clerk has access to just as many resources as a doctor, they are 'paid' (rewarded) the same. newlinechar  newlinechar In capitalism, yes. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; But if you are the doctor, wouldn't you leave the communist society in favor of a capitalist society if it means you have access to more resources? newlinechar  newlinechar Possibly, depends on why you became a doctor.  Lots of doctors actually go to and live for extended periods of time in place with very little resources to help people in need.  But even if we concede this point, it's not clear why you believe a doctor would have more resources in a capitalist society as opposed to a communist one, nor is it clear why you believe someone would simply be 'a doctor' in a communist society. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Therefore, based on this logic... newlinechar  newlinechar You've not applied any logic, and it doesn't help that what logic you think you've applied has relatively little if anything to do with a communist society.  If your goal was to critique equal wages in a capitalist system, perhaps you have succeeded.  A doctor who receives equal wages to a store clerk in a society where access to resources is determined by wages and who has no motivation for being a doctor beyond obtaining as many fucking resources as possible might leave a system wherein equal wages were paid for one where they were not. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; I believe fewer people would want to be doctors in a communist society, if they can be a store clerk without spending years putting in hard work newlinechar  newlinechar You're not talking about a communist society if you're talking about wage-labor and exchange of money for commodities.

Blockchains accept the longest chain as truth, so if you have sufficient hash power you can rewrite an arbitrary amount of the chain.  And again, it makes no sense for banks to engage in a hash-power contest (which is the part that actually secures the network, otherwise it's trivial to have enough hash-power to rewrite a bunch of the blockchain). newlinechar  newlinechar Databases are perfectly secure in and of themselves, if you don't have UPDATE or DELETE permissions then you can't do those operations.  Human errors are a separate problem, and not one that is solved by blockchain - as you can clearly see by the long history of exchanges and services getting hacked and having their wallets stolen.

Honestly, it's probably that and some musics are intertwined with the game itself, so it'd be hard to replace them all
Yeah but your armature is less important than it is in brass.  Most brass players I've seen can struggle for 10-20 years to get rid of the nasal sound, and many never do figure it out.  It's really tricky.  One issue I didn't touch on is double reed instruments can get really painful to play, with the two tiny reeds buzzing against your lips.  There's a reason they say bassoon and oboe are the hardest instruments to play.  French horn is probably right behind them.  But as far as musical knowledge required to play, piano and guitar are harder, by far.  Drums are probably the most fun, though.  There's just something about beating on something.  And once you get it, you get it.  After you learn how to break down a beat and build your own beats, you feel like a musical god.  I recommend every musician to learn drums if they want to get into song writing.  I've known some great musicians that couldn't write a song to save their life, because they didn't understand beat structure. newlinechar  newlinechar Oops I left out a few words.

And if the police doesn't have ways to deal with that, it is not a police but a shitty group of random idiots with guns. You can't treat everyone as if they are about to shoot you. If you start with that premise, you purposely risk the lives of innocent people.  newlinechar A police that doesn't have higher standards, trainings and support to deal with pressure like that is not worth the name. Not saying mistakes can't happen anyway... But you can do stuff to reduce that risks and since the USA have a very bad record compared to other western countries... It is pretty clear that the recruiting and training of police staff is poorly done and if you mix that with a general gun fetish and some other weird stuff that is going on (poor oversight, idiotic law and order philosophy, etc) you get a culture within the police that enforces the 'us versus them' mentality that leads to the death of innocent people.

What? The Mayor Stephanie Rawlings said to give them space and let them burn the city down. I actually went to high school with her brother who sat behind me 4 years in a row. There was no proof of a 'rough ride'. If you watch the video of the kid being put in the wagon he's already in pain. I think the cops did it, but certainly not intentionally.

Yep exactly correct. You probably already know what to do and how it works, so all you can do is hop in and start practicing. As long as you don't slip the clutch and burn it out the car will be just fine. It's all about finding the position on the pedal where the clutch 'bites' and building muscle memory.  newlinechar  newlinechar Definitely practice hill starts a bunch before driving it daily, unless you live somewhere without hills. Hill starts are basically the only potentially dangerous situation because stalling on flat ground is no big deal. newlinechar  newlinechar Obviously getting a lesson from someone you know with a manual will help, but as myself and many others have stated it isn't necessary as long as you've got the time to practice after purchase and don't mind some minor public embarrassment over the next month.

Might be the fact that that's where the game starts opening up, but without actually mentioning it. You leave Goodsprings with one goal: New Vegas via Primm. However, once you finish Primm, that's not your only goal. There are several threads to choose from. You could find a replacement sheriff, figure out what EDE is, investigate the NCR, or investigate the Powder Gangers. Here is where the exploration of the world starts, and you could argue that the game is no longer guiding you on any distinct path.
Can I make it any more clear? **At the end of *Return of the Jedi*,** Luke is the most powerful Jedi alive. You know, 'cause Yoda's dead and all that, and also because according to the Prequels Luke was more powerful than Yoda the entire time.
Would you say we are better interior wise defensively than UK? You scored 22 two point field goals on them and 10 threes and only 8 two point field goals and 10 threes against us. Were your guards able to drive on them? I see you only took 3 more shots against Uk than you did Cuse, but 30 points less in the box score.

I get that, but dying itself can do some pretty messed up things to your body (car wrecks, etc.) Cultural mores also change, so a push to change them for the sake of saving lives would be a good thing. It may take a generation or two, but it's not like we're at the mercy of culture and nothing can be done about it. That aside, you have your choice of what you donate. If having your skin and eyes taken bothers you, you don't need to do it. You can just donate your vital organs. newlinechar  newlinechar On another note, I'm not sure where you're living now, but in many places you can request to be buried in a shroud, and avoid all nasty embalming practices (which I assume you're also against).

Deleted my other response because I didn't feel it was in depth enough. newlinechar  newlinechar Here's how I do it: newlinechar  newlinechar Start with a basic plot line newlinechar  newlinechar Turn that into a paragraph, first sentence is the beginning, second is the first act, third is the second act, fourth is the third act, and fifth is the resolution. Each sentence should end in disaster except for the resolution unless that's the point. newlinechar  newlinechar Then take each sentence and ask yourself who, what, where, why, and how. Don't worry about sentences like the guide tells you, the point is the amount of content, not the amount of periods. By the end you should have five paragraphs. newlinechar  newlinechar Then take each sentence of each paragraph and break it down even further with the exact same method. You should have around 25 paragraphs at the end of this step. newlinechar  newlinechar When you're done, revise all of it. Your plot line can serve as the pitch you send to publishers, your paragraph can serve as your elevator pitch, and your page could be your larger synopsis for whatever reason you may want to use it for. newlinechar  newlinechar Revise the final product as well so that it flows better and doesn't feel like you're ticking off a bunch of boxes, but the full 25 paragraphs should be for your own use primarily. newlinechar  newlinechar By that point you should have a very in depth and detailed outline of the big beats your story will hit.
Thank you! You are so lucky that you have a supportive husband with regards to telling those close to you early.  My husband would prefer to wait until the 2nd trimester because if something happens, he doesn’t want to devastate our family even more, but I tell him that they would know anyway, so it’s not a big difference either way. He accepted that we will be telling our parents by week 8 even though he doesn’t agree with it...if I can even wait that long. Lol

Honestly, I don't really know. I guess it's kind of chemical... the way some men smell makes me horny. If I'm flirting with a dude and he like, touches my arm or my back or something it just feels good to me in a way I haven't experienced with women. It's more tactile than sight based. I also tend to prefer scrawny men with more androgynous features...

For the use case that Electroneum will be marketing, most users will never touch a paper wallet, right? Isn't it supposed to be a spendable currency?

When a stock/coin price goes up quickly, there is often a pullback because the perceived value is less than current price.   newlinechar Incidentally, it also often establishes a new “floor” for the stock/coin and you have a higher starting point for the next rise.  For example, a month ago LTC was under $100. We had a massive run up to 300, then peeked over 400, before it corrected to ~$200, which seems to be the new floor.  Next floor $400?  :)

As it is minimum wage is not much more than slavery.

I would personally pick Xenoblade 2 but that's up to what game you want. Skyrim is a good game that you can put hundreds of hours into but it can be found on any other console for half as much as the Switch version. Skyrim is also a port of an older game and comes with many glitches that can really ruin immersion, but can also make for some hilarious moments. My biggest issue with the switch version is that it's still just Skyrim. The only thing that this version has that the others don't is very bad BotW armor. The good thing about Xenoblade 2 is that it's a new game that you can ONLY get on the Switch. Xenoblade 2 is far more complex than Skyrim aswell. There are many hours dedicated to optimization of gear and your partners, so if grinding in order to catch up with the story isn't your thing then it may not be the game for you. Just remember, if you do pick Xenoblade 2, make sure to turn on Japanese voices. The English voices are so bad that I actually went into a cringe-induced coma for 2 weeks. Both games have great things to offer so I hope that this helped you in someway.

They slide down my ears without the rubber band mod, and with it they are too tight and hurt my jaw after an hour or so of gaming. Overall terrible design and easily one of my most disappointing purchases.
Not in Australia. We don't have the population to support it. Imagine the damage to the game in the respective states if any of Perth/Adelaide/Brisbane were relegated. NSW/Vic needs to be the focal point but there needs to be constant representation in each state for the benefit of the game as a whole.
We do actually provide it to people at their most vulnerable. People on welfare, ODSP, people over 65 and people with high medication costs (more than 3-4 percent of their after-tax income) already get this coverage. It's being extended now to everyone under 25.

I think it would be nice to (perhaps?) be that care free. My mom was really beyond harsh when i was a kid (and into adulthood.) Even things that weren’t my fault (being ill, rape, her father beating me, etc.) I would get into trouble for. So I think that’s what makes me the way I am. If I would have lost something of any significance she would have destroyed me emotionally. And it’d last for a while. newlinechar  newlinechar I’d trade so many lost things for a mentally stable mother and an emotionally stable childhood.

Again, it's like you're trying to miss the point, people just don't think the jokes are funny, they're not good jokes. newlinechar  newlinechar It's subjective whether the jokes are funny but you can't invalidate someone thinking they're unfunny by saying 'oh you're just offended'

&gt; Paid heroes wouldn't work in OW for obvious reasons newlinechar  newlinechar I mean, they 'wouldn't work' in R6S for 'obvious reasons' either, R6S operators aren't perfectly balanced. Hibana, Valkyrie, and Blackbeard have been top tier since they were released. That doesn't stop Ubisoft from demanding that players shell out. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; I wish you could just buy in-game credits to get cosmetic items. newlinechar  newlinechar You can! Buy lootboxes, get dupe gold. If you're a brand new player who still needs to unlock a lot of commons and rares, the investment you have to make to first buy those out might be pretty steep. So I don't advise this for brand new players. But if you're already getting 4 dupes per box, $25 buys you a(n almost) guaranteed 750 dupe gold minimum, with the potential for *much* more if you get any epic/rare gold chests. (And if you got less than 750, it's because you got a lot of non-dupe epics/legendaries, which you're not likely to be complaining about) newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Overwatch wouldn't necessarily be making less money than it is today, considering there would still be 35 million players who could buy stuff newlinechar  newlinechar Those things have absolutely nothing to do with each other. Even if 'there would still be 35 million players who could buy stuff' (there aren't, there are 35 million *accounts* not players), and even if many of them would still buy a lot of stuff, that still does not prove that 'Overwatch wouldn't necessarily be making less money than it is today.' In fact it's possible it could be making SIGNIFICANTLY less money. You just can't know that without looking at their data.

1. Perfect Pitch is absolutely not a limitation - in fact, having it can be a limitation. newlinechar 2. Yeah, hard to get away from that one! My advice would be to remember that music is an ART not a science. Everything in music is context-based. newlinechar 3. Would really recommend you try to learn a musical instrument - keyboard at least - even if just enough to run through chords - but you need to know what you're doing with notes and so on. newlinechar  newlinechar Yes. newlinechar  newlinechar There are general rules that define musical styles. I'm trying to think of any kind of engineering analogies but I'm not remotely familiar with the field. We could say that Clocks, Metronomes, Timers, and Stopwatches are all 'Timepieces'. And they work on very similar mechanisms. But because each has a different purpose, they might be designed differently - for example, with a clock with a pendulum you always want it two swing once or twice per second (whatever makes it work). But with a metronome, you want to be able to adjust that. So the same 'rules' don't apply. The metronome has to have something extra that the clock doesn't. And A Timer needs to run in reverse, and a stopwatch needs to start, stop, and reset. And there are completely different styles between analog gear-driven mechanisms and digital timepieces. And just to throw a wrench in, don't forget that there are analog timepieces like sundials, and those pendulums that swing but stay in the same direction even through the Earth rotates. There are 'water clocks' and 'ball bearing clocks' and so on. newlinechar  newlinechar So music is much the same - Mozart doesn't use 'Blues Scales' newlinechar  newlinechar But since music is an art, we can absolutely juxtapose styles - we can play a Moxart style accompaniment that's diatonic, and put a blues scale over top. Or we can take a Baroque piece and play it in a Jazz feel (like Jethro Tull's version of Bach's Bouree in Em). newlinechar  newlinechar Sometimes these can come off as just silly, but other times they can create new and interesting styles or stylistic offshoots - much in the way that Steampunk kind of juxtaposes victorian-era steam-based principles with modernistic mechanisms that didn't or couldn't exist back then. newlinechar  newlinechar So 'rules' simply define a given style. If you don't play any blue notes in your blues, it's not going to sound very bluesy! But if you start adding blue notes into a Baroque concerto, it may sound wholly out of place. newlinechar  newlinechar When creating your own music, you can create your own style but you have to remember that listeners are going in with preconceived notions so if you do things that don't sound 'logical' to them based on what tidbits of style you're giving them, they're going to think it sounds bad. newlinechar  newlinechar So you can absolutely play a Whole Tone melody against a 4 note chromatic harmony that shares only two notes. But since that wouldn't be following the rules of most existing styles, it's not going to be effective. It's like calling something a clock but it only moves from 0 to 1 and back. Or takes 70 years for 1 unit to pass. Sure, it's 'music', but it may be missing the things that delmit the definition. newlinechar  newlinechar But if you only follow the rules for a style in art, you just end up making another boring old clock. Music is more like the Goofy (Disney character) watch I used to have - it ran backwards. It stretched the definition of a watch enough to be interesting and creative, without doing it so much that it was no longer a timepiece.

There’s no need to be a condescending prick...

There’s plenty of people out there that are egalitarian and believe in true gender equality.  newlinechar  newlinechar We know this because many of us here used to be *those types of feminists*, especially the younger MRA’s ... Many of us were raised in a society where feminism has been the default standard regarding gender equality. We were raised with the ideals that feminism is supposed to stand for... that women are equals and should be treated equally as men.... So we know that those people out there exist because we used to be them and we know plenty of people in our lives that are egalitarian and still identify as feminists.  newlinechar  newlinechar The entire point of that “Real Feminists” comment was to highlight the unfortunate fact that **those people don’t matter**.   newlinechar  newlinechar Those people don’t have any power or influence over the mainstream feminist movement. They aren’t the career professional feminists who work for feminist organizations like NOW, that lobby the governments to influence public policy and pass misandrist anti male policies that give women special treatment.... or launch propaganda campaigns that mislead the public and negatively effect society’s collective view of men. They aren’t the feminist in academia that come up with all the ridiculous feminist theories for which these policies are based. They aren’t the activists that are our protesting men’s conferences or spreading misinformation and lies to the general public convincing everyone that men don’t have any real problems. newlinechar  newlinechar *THOSE* are the people that matter... Those are the people that actually make an impact on society and do things that negatively effect our lives.... The Mainstream feminist movement is the only feminists that actually matter and that’s why they are the people we actually focus on.  newlinechar  newlinechar And that’s why we don’t focus much on the good hearted egalitarian people out there ... because there isn’t any reason to....  newlinechar  newlinechar I mean, what exactly would you like us to do? Every time we point out ways in which mainstream feminism harms men, male victims, and men’s issues in general... are we supposed to preface it first with “NotAllFeminists” ?? Are we supposed to remind the readers of all the causal feminists out there who believe in gender equality but don’t actually do much of... anything?  newlinechar  newlinechar Why would we do that? What’s the purpose in that?   newlinechar  newlinechar It’s like comparing all the people that play football with their friends on the weekend to all the professional athletes in the NFL .... which group actually matters when discussing football?  newlinechar  newlinechar It’s the same thing with feminism and gender politics discussions.... Those people don’t influence my life in any way... but all the mainstream feminists out there sure as hell do and that’s why I actively try to fight against them.  newlinechar  newlinechar You’re coming here acting like you understand everyone’s perspectives when you really dont have a clue ... Nobody here is trying to pretend that every person in this world who identifies as a feminist is one of the man hating lunatics we always point out. It’s just those people don’t matter so why would we waste time talking about them? newlinechar  newlinechar And if you disagree with my perspective... then kindly tell me how those “good hearted” feminist actually matter. Please give me some examples as to how those people actually make a difference in society like all the professional feminists that make up the feminist movement.  newlinechar  newlinechar Do you seriously believe those egalitarian casual feminists have as much power and influence as all the people in the examples I gave you? ... If the answer is no, then ask yourself why should I bother with them then?  newlinechar  newlinechar If those people matter and actually have influence.... then why aren’t they stepping in and reigning in all the power hungry misandrists that run the feminist movement? Why aren’t they telling mainstream feminism, “hey, you’ve gone too far! You are hurting men and you need to stop!”?? Why aren’t those people doing anything to reform the feminist movement and hold it accountable to all the ideals that feminism is supposed to stand for?  newlinechar  newlinechar **If all those good hearted, rational, egalitarian feminists out there don’t have the power to actually change things within the feminist movement.... then they don’t matter one bit... And if they don’t actually matter... then why the hell should I focus on them?... All the feminists that do have power and influence, they are going to continue making men’s lives worse and I will continue to fight against that movement because of it.** newlinechar  newlinechar If all the “good feminists” like yourself are so important... then here’s a crazy idea, Why don’t you guys actually fix the problems within your movement and why don’t you make Feminism stand for the ideals and beliefs that it claims to? newlinechar  newlinechar Oh, that’s right.... You can’t.... because you don’t have the power or influence to change a damn thing.

We're operating on different definitions of 'liberal' so I'll admit to being wrong regarding your intent when posting to /r/shitliberalssay.

I dont think that's right, but OK.
It does sound fairly similar, particularly now I know a bit more.  newlinechar  newlinechar The houses here are also usually in 'bad' places. My area is the sort of area people say not to go into, as you will most likely get stabbed. Gang crime is becoming a massive problem in the UK now, and from what I know, is also a problem in the US. My friend and I like to joke about our area (she is in council housing too, and has been her entire life). We live in one of the 'chavviest' places. I live in a slightly nicer area than some, mind.  newlinechar  newlinechar I do not believe the UK system is better, nor worse. There has been a massive problem with housing recently. Emergency tempory housing is just that, tempory, it should only be for a few weeks. Recently, it has come out that some have spent years in these places. There is a 'lack of housing'. Little does the BBC know that one of my mothers friend works for the council. There is housing. The blocks of flats I live by are fairly empty. It's just that there are a lot of problems that could arise, such as suicides and asbestos (to be fair, my house has asbestos tiles, and my school is believed to have asbestos...). Still.  newlinechar  newlinechar I do believe that more should be done about these properties, and the people who live in them. People like my brother are problems. We can be kicked out for a number of things, such as noise. He's loud, because he plays on the Xbox one his dad got him. He ripped his door off and broke mine because he got angry because he was banned online. If he does anything else wrong, my mother is kicking him out. That's a different story though. Point is, more should be done in both countries to improve the conditions of the housing, and helping those who are decent people to be safe.

&gt;They don’t even *say* it’s suggestive, and I promise you that they would if they believed that could demonstrate that it was. newlinechar  newlinechar I guess they put too much faith in people's power of deductive reasoning, since you seem to think they're pointing this out for no reason and that researchers would waste their time noting two related events but not go into cause whatsoever. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;The most you can say about their data is that it fails to rule out the possibility, which is a much weaker claim. newlinechar  newlinechar First off it's an abstract. You have their conclusions, not the extent of their data. newlinechar  newlinechar Secondly, as I've already said, they're drawing a clear parallel between the two events. You can scream 'correlation doesn't equal causation' and once again ignore that, as researchers, the first thing they'd establish is cause.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;There’s not anything “semantic” about this distinction. newlinechar  newlinechar You are literally arguing about the language used, asserting that they didn't literally state 'We conclude this' despite the obvious intent of the abstract making the clear suggestion.

I think they mean as like a mainstream / staple step in your routine. Back when I was in high school, only really out of touch people markered their eyebrows in. Everyone who was into the beauty scene was plucked, but no makeup. Throughout the 2010's it's really grown in popularity.

Plus, every reason she gives as to why it most likely isn't true, is textbook the case when it turns out there *was* abuse. So many follow these exact guidelines; they're common because a lot of these cases have similar patterns, and that makes it easier to narrow down whose case is (scarily enough) true. Obviously CPS and all others involved have to investigate hopefully to the letter to clear this up -- I'd much rather the accusation be false, as I'm sure everyone does! -- but I'm hesitate to think the daughter was coached about this. Even just looking at one of the reasons, which was that the daughter has been to the doctor because of soreness, correlates a lot with confirmed cases. Or the new SO being too sweet and kind to do such a thing is unrealistic. Children can be manipulated, but like this? Better to be safe than sorry. As much as it sucks, in the case of sexual abuse with children, I'd prefer all measures be taken, and the boyfriend removed ASAP. If this turns out to be false, then the father needs to be punished and time spent with his daughter be completely supervised from here-on out.
His choice, sure.

Sex and relationships is/are nuanced and complex.  newlinechar  newlinechar But yes, some things are problematic and not to be ignored as just one of those things. It's just not healthy.  newlinechar  newlinechar Furthermore, should he ever wish to see a doctor due to not being able to ejaculate and therefore have children it would not be a case of 'men are not automotons, sorry. Off you go' they would explore this fully. Because it's not normal. For him, for any man. Hence, dysfunction.  newlinechar  newlinechar Does it mean he can never enjoy good sex even if he never orgasms again by any means? No. Again.

Yeah, when I was in college, the look was thinner, sparser eyebrows. You plucked/shaped/waxed them and then at most used clear brow gel if they were still unruly. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm lucky that my brows were naturally fuller, because years of that made them permanently sparser, but I'm still mad I lost my cute Daenerys brows to that trend.

I have no idea why people think a religious rebellion would lead to anything other than a theocracy, but apparently the same dumb asses are still around. Some still think that the 'moderate rebels' in Syria would be better than an asshole dictator, but when it comes to those guys you just have to pick and choose which group gets victimized the most and who will become the favored group. One difference with these protestors is that the establishment is the theocracy.

&gt;For men who already do something, or do not have the power to do something, this is frustrating. newlinechar  newlinechar I have plenty of male friends who both have stepped up and those who do not have the power to step up who are not frustrated. You can’t speak for all men.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;It is telling that you deem men who are unhappy with this situation, and want men and women to be equally responsible for policing such behaviour, as an example of women's needs to be placed behind the need for men's emotional support. newlinechar  newlinechar The men here are frustrated by pretty much every single issue that has anything to do with women. How many threads in the recent past are about women’s issues and don’t feature men talking about their own frustration? I’m willing to bet close to nil. Have any of you even asked women what we do in these situations? How many drinks I’ve had to watch? How many men I’ve had to shove out of the way because a friend of mine is drunk at a club? How many of my female friends have done that for me? We *are* the ones policing this behavior but because you all don’t see it, you assume it doesn’t exist. Now I’m sure this is the point where you turn it around on me and say that I don’t see it either when it comes to men but this is an article written by a man who hangs out with men who is suggesting that you all don’t actually do it so perhaps some of you could have the conversation about why it to men like Terry Crews and to many women it seems like men often do jack shit. But that isn’t a conversation that anyone is going to have here because, again, everyone must voice their frustrations. And only their frustrations. Far be it for me to tell you all how to converse (even if I did just that) but the song gets just as tiresome as the feminist song probably gets to many of you (as it certainly has for me).

I mean I think Zeke has shown that RB isn’t an irrelevant position. And the first 2 games without Zeke also suffered some serious OL injuries that ruined any sort of gameplay they wanted to run without Zeke. I can make an argument for the offense collapsing without Zeke given that he is a huge threat and none of the WRs are really seen as threats anymore.  newlinechar  newlinechar What’s harder to defend is how much worse the defense got without Sean Lee. The lack of depth at LB was a huge oversight by the coaching staff and that had a huge effect on the team in some of the earlier, winnable games (Green Bay and Los Angeles).

It was a shit year, and when you look at our wins and losses it looks even worse. 7 of our 9 wins came against teams starting a rookie or backup qb. This team sucked and was lucky to be in it in the end. I’m not blinded by Home colors enough to the point where I can’t criticize my own team and staff. I hope the rest of this sub can take off the purple glasses too. newlinechar  newlinechar The simple fact of the matter is that 2012 was a legit miracle, but in Harbaughs 10 year tenure we only have 2 division titles while being potential title contenders in like 70-80% of those seasons, and we’ve missed the playoffs 4 times in the last 5 years. Something has to be said about that. As successful as this team has been, we’ve been very unsuccessful when you really look at it.
Absolutely agree... Lose Zeke and your offense collapses. Lose Lee and your defense collapses...doesn't seem like a well built team IMO
