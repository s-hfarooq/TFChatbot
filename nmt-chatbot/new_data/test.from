This would be on my shortlist too - for the world building.  Never before nor since have I had the opportunity to explore a world that felt so alien. newlinechar  newlinechar Usually fantasy is too clearly a Tolkein/Forgotten Realms descended world, (and sci-fi so easily shows its Star Wars/Aliens parentage) and while the mechanics of the Elder Scrolls games are absolutely of the D&amp;D family tree, the world at least tried to be exotic. newlinechar  newlinechar I imagine it couldn't have been particularly successful for it, as Oblivion was as classic fantasy as it comes, and Skyrim only slightly less so.
Like I said, it's clear that this is all new stuff to you. I'm not going to take more time to 'convince' you of these things. If you're really interested in clearing up your confusion, there are incredible resources at your disposal, including entire subreddits full of people who would be glad to help you understand. I've mentioned psychology and eastern philosophy in particular. Any google search or subreddit related to those topics will more than be able to fill in the gaps. Best of luck to you.
As a network engineer I'd just like to say, Marriott does have a point to some degree. 3 non overlapping channels of 2.4ghz spectrum means hotspots in common areas will impact the performance of the hotel wifi guests are paying for, and there's legitimate concerns about network impersonation. newlinechar  newlinechar That said, I think Cisco is on the right track with their response. Enterprise network operators should be able to protect their network by deauth-ing malicious AP's, but I think this should be limited to cases where the AP in question is impersonating an existing SID, or clearly attempting to mislead users (e.g. broadcasting a 'Company X Wifi' SSID). Using that approach against non-malicious devices like personal hotspots is a different beast. Since wifi spectrum is unlicensed and hotspot users have a right to use it that's equal with the hotel's, I don't think that should be permitted.

Exactly. I have no problem with them shutting down hotspots that are guaranteed to disrupt their network.

You would need to know the size of what you're wrapping around.  Simple as that.  I estimate based on the metric sizes I know.  The screwdriver I wrap my coils around is about 2.5 mm.

I love Drogba, but Remy deserves at least half of the chances he's got so far. He's great for hold up play when we need a goal, usually a header (Newcastle loss is a great example), but his pace slows down the team overall which usually is a bad thing. He's done very well for a 36 year old striker who many thought was just a leadership signing, but I think Remy would've put away all the chances Drogba has so far and probably a few more. It's not just his pace too you notice his decline. His shot is still strong, but it's clearly lost quite a bit of power and accuracy behind it. Poor Remy has done his role perfectly when he's got his few chances and the one he did start, he scored early but got injured celebrating. Really don't know what more he could be doing to get the occasional nod over Drogba. I guess I can't criticize Jose too much though until it ends up hurting us though. newlinechar  newlinechar 
D'aw. Pretty accurate on my end too. :'3

As a network engineer I'd just like to say, Marriott does have a point to some degree. 3 non overlapping channels of 2.4ghz spectrum means hotspots in common areas will impact the performance of the hotel wifi guests are paying for, and there's legitimate concerns about network impersonation. newlinechar  newlinechar That said, I think Cisco is on the right track with their response. Enterprise network operators should be able to protect their network by deauth-ing malicious AP's, but I think this should be limited to cases where the AP in question is impersonating an existing SID, or clearly attempting to mislead users (e.g. broadcasting a 'Company X Wifi' SSID). Using that approach against non-malicious devices like personal hotspots is a different beast. Since wifi spectrum is unlicensed and hotspot users have a right to use it that's equal with the hotel's, I don't think that should be permitted.

I love Drogba, but Remy deserves at least half of the chances he's got so far. He's great for hold up play when we need a goal, usually a header (Newcastle loss is a great example), but his pace slows down the team overall which usually is a bad thing. He's done very well for a 36 year old striker who many thought was just a leadership signing, but I think Remy would've put away all the chances Drogba has so far and probably a few more. It's not just his pace too you notice his decline. His shot is still strong, but it's clearly lost quite a bit of power and accuracy behind it. Poor Remy has done his role perfectly when he's got his few chances and the one he did start, he scored early but got injured celebrating. Really don't know what more he could be doing to get the occasional nod over Drogba. I guess I can't criticize Jose too much though until it ends up hurting us though. newlinechar  newlinechar 
D'aw. Pretty accurate on my end too. :'3

As a network engineer I'd just like to say, Marriott does have a point to some degree. 3 non overlapping channels of 2.4ghz spectrum means hotspots in common areas will impact the performance of the hotel wifi guests are paying for, and there's legitimate concerns about network impersonation. newlinechar  newlinechar That said, I think Cisco is on the right track with their response. Enterprise network operators should be able to protect their network by deauth-ing malicious AP's, but I think this should be limited to cases where the AP in question is impersonating an existing SID, or clearly attempting to mislead users (e.g. broadcasting a 'Company X Wifi' SSID). Using that approach against non-malicious devices like personal hotspots is a different beast. Since wifi spectrum is unlicensed and hotspot users have a right to use it that's equal with the hotel's, I don't think that should be permitted.

Exactly. I have no problem with them shutting down hotspots that are guaranteed to disrupt their network.

You would need to know the size of what you're wrapping around.  Simple as that.  I estimate based on the metric sizes I know.  The screwdriver I wrap my coils around is about 2.5 mm.

I love Drogba, but Remy deserves at least half of the chances he's got so far. He's great for hold up play when we need a goal, usually a header (Newcastle loss is a great example), but his pace slows down the team overall which usually is a bad thing. He's done very well for a 36 year old striker who many thought was just a leadership signing, but I think Remy would've put away all the chances Drogba has so far and probably a few more. It's not just his pace too you notice his decline. His shot is still strong, but it's clearly lost quite a bit of power and accuracy behind it. Poor Remy has done his role perfectly when he's got his few chances and the one he did start, he scored early but got injured celebrating. Really don't know what more he could be doing to get the occasional nod over Drogba. I guess I can't criticize Jose too much though until it ends up hurting us though. newlinechar  newlinechar 
D'aw. Pretty accurate on my end too. :'3

Enterprise network operators should be able to protect their network by deauth-ing malicious AP's, but I think this should be limited to cases where the AP in question is impersonating an existing SID, or clearly attempting to mislead users (e.g. broadcasting a 'Company X Wifi' SSID). Using that approach against non-malicious devices like personal hotspots is a different beast. Since wifi spectrum is unlicensed and hotspot users have a right to use it that's equal with the hotel's, I don't think that should be permitted.

&gt;Also, the A10 can loiter over the battlefield for almost an hour, and be serviced on a country road. The 35 needs way more service time and can only loiter like 20 minutes. newlinechar  newlinechar The A-10's loiter time in contested airspace is generally defined by how long it takes to hit the ground after being shot down. Loiter times in uncontested airspace are a function of human endurance and how long it takes for tankers to get tired of you.

How would you compare it to The Descent? Haven't watched AASB, as it seemed to be on first impressions quite similar plotwise to The Descent, and I'm not a huge fan of deja vu when viewing a film.
Omg, I used to just quit the battle when there was only my HT against other Human Torch. It would take ages to even deal some damage at all.

Mormon here. Can confirm that I am not drunk, nor have been drinking. I did drink root beer, though. Does that count? I had ice cream with it, too. 
Yeah, essentially people post their spare room for rent on a nightly basis and people stay there instead of a hotel. AirBnb however provides insurance and is a Billion dollar company.

Eh, I would like to see Diego Costa start since he didn't play home match vs. Spurs. Also we have a FA cup vs. Watford in between so we can rest him then and let Remy or Drogba start. Who am I kidding, Drogba is going to start against Watford.

An explanation I've heard before was that it kind of works as a form of national security. A country such as China wouldn't want to attack the U.S. and lose whatever trillion dollar investment they put into us. I might be wrong though, so don't quote me on that.

What, forcefully overthrowing the United States government, which spends more on its military than the next 13 countries combined? newlinechar  newlinechar Yes, yes, that sounds very romantic and all, but really think about what that entails. You're talking about another civil war. All that will do is get American people paranoid and freaked out about Socialism (again), get a bunch of Socialists jailed and killed, and set the Socialist movement back a hundred years.

Morrowind did super well actually, it just happened to take place in one of the weirdest parts of the Elder Scrolls universe.  newlinechar  newlinechar Oblivion was bland classic fantasy because it took place in the bland classic fantasy region of the world; Skyrim was all manly vikings because that's who live in Skyrim (all the zombies were due to a lack of imagination, though). 
Thanks, but no thanks.

Best of luck with that 'believe everything I read' thing. newlinechar  newlinechar Also thanks for the one source (re: your ass) you got all of this information from.
Exactly. I have no problem with them shutting down hotspots that are guaranteed to disrupt their network. Realistically though, if that's what they're going to do they should just give free wifi (in which case I think a lot of people's complaints about them shutting down their hotspots disappear). Hell, just bake the price into the overnight price at the very least. newlinechar  newlinechar Every time someone says 'how could they possibly do this' I think 'you've never lived in an apartment building in the last 5 years'
that's an absolute fleecing.

Plot wise, nothing similar. Two entire different worlds in what's happening. It's similar to The Descent in the aspect that it's a group of adventurers in close quarters who get themselves in a 'no way back' situation. The movie atmosphere is very dark and claustrophobic.

You would need to know the size of what you're wrapping around.  Simple as that.  I estimate based on the metric sizes I know.  The screwdriver I wrap my coils around is about 2.5 mm.  I could measure the diameter, but I just eyeballed it.  I build contact coils, so the distance between wraps is 0 and the rest I already know.  Then I get the gist of what my coil's heat index is.    newlinechar  newlinechar I just plug in numbers and see what looks good, but then I use an ohmmeter to check how close my build is before using it.

I love Drogba, but Remy deserves at least half of the chances he's got so far. He's great for hold up play when we need a goal, usually a header (Newcastle loss is a great example), but his pace slows down the team overall which usually is a bad thing. He's done very well for a 36 year old striker who many thought was just a leadership signing, but I think Remy would've put away all the chances Drogba has so far and probably a few more. It's not just his pace too you notice his decline. His shot is still strong, but it's clearly lost quite a bit of power and accuracy behind it. Poor Remy has done his role perfectly when he's got his few chances and the one he did start, he scored early but got injured celebrating. Really don't know what more he could be doing to get the occasional nod over Drogba. I guess I can't criticize Jose too much though until it ends up hurting us though. newlinechar  newlinechar 
D'aw. Pretty accurate on my end too. :'3

I didn't see the second one but what they did to Curt Connors in the first made me die a little inside. Destroyed the whole Jekyll/Hyde dynamic that makes the character's relationship with Spider-Man so interesting and instead turned him into generic throwaway villain with a British accent for no reason other than to make him sound more evil. Garf's a hell of a lot better than Mopey McSigher in the role though.
